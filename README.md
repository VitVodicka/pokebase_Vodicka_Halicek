A school assignment built using data from the public PokeAPI.
The goal was to create a Pokémon store-like interface that displays Pokémon based on generations and various filter parameters.
I implemented a significant portion of the project, including API communication and UI logic.

Features

Fetches Pokémon from PokeAPI

Filtering by generation and other parameters

Store-like layout for browsing Pokémon

Notes

Depends on the live PokeAPI — requires internet connection.
